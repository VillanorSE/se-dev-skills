# Space Engineers Reputation & NPC Factions

General guide to how vanilla SE stores and changes player<->faction reputation, how NPC factions get created and why
they never go away, and how mods (MES) change reputation. Nothing here is specific to one project. Claims are tagged:

- **[HARD]** verified in a file or source I opened (decompiled/IL of `Sandbox.Game.dll`, a real save, MES `.cs` source, vanilla `.sbc`)
- **[SOFT]** inferred from code or standard behavior, not observed running
- **[UNVERIFIED]** plausible but unchecked - test before relying on it

Source examined: SE `Bin64\Sandbox.Game.dll` (IL of `MyFactionCollection`, `MyFaction`, `MySessionComponentEconomy`, `MyAgentBot`,
`MyPirateAntennas`, world generator), vanilla `Content\Data`, MES 2.74.02, two real world saves. **[HARD]** Re-check after SE updates.

## Core model (read this first)

1. **Everything funnels into one setter.** `MyFactionCollection.ChangeReputationWithPlayer` is reached by the admin menu,
   the mod API `IMyFactionCollection.SetReputationBetweenPlayerAndFaction` (MES uses this), contracts, vanilla damage,
   decay and visual scripting. **[HARD]** Details: `references/vanilla-reputation.md`.
2. **`StaticReputation` freezes reputation for every path, not just damage.** In that setter, a static faction returns
   early if the player already has a value, or forces `StartingReputation` on the first write. **[HARD]**
   A reputation mod/admin command that "does nothing" against a faction is almost always this.
3. **Vanilla damage reputation is controlled by `ReputationSettings.sbc`** (`DefaultReputationSettings`): loss =
   `damage / ReputationLossDamage * <GrindingWelding|Damaging|Stealing|Killing>`. Set the multipliers to 0 to switch it off
   without making the faction static. **[HARD]**
4. **Decay pulls reputation back toward the faction's starting value** at `ReputationDecayPerHour` (economy definition,
   vanilla 50). Set it to 0 to keep earned reputation. **[HARD]** (field use) / **[SOFT]** (exact target per faction type)
5. **Factions persist in the save forever.** Definitions only decide what is *created*; nothing deletes a faction whose
   definition changes. **[HARD]** See `references/factions-lifecycle.md`.

## The traps that cost the most time

- **`IsDefault:false` does not keep a faction out.** It only skips default-faction creation for *new* worlds. Scenario
  starts (`AddShipPrefab` with `<FactionTag>`), agent bots with a `<FactionTag>`, and the mod API all create factions by tag,
  ignoring `IsDefault`. **[HARD]** A vanilla scenario start creates `SPRT`. **[HARD]** (`Scenarios.sbx`)
- **Changing `IsDefault`/`StaticReputation` doesn't touch existing factions' membership, but `StaticReputation`,
  `StartingReputation`, `AcceptHumans`, `AutoAcceptMember`, `EnableFriendlyFire` ARE re-read from the definition on every load**
  (`MyFaction(MyObjectBuilder_Faction)` ctor looks the definition up by tag). **[HARD]** So un-static'ing a faction works on an
  existing save after a reload.
- **Removing a faction means editing `Sandbox.sbc`** (game closed) or calling `IMyFactionCollection.RemoveFaction` from a script.
  **[HARD]** (API exists) - `scripts/rep_remove_faction.py` does the save edit safely.
- **MES grid-trigger reputation caps don't parse.** On `[RivalAI Action]`, `[ReputationMinCap:]`, `[ReputationMaxCap:]` and
  `[ReputationChangesForAllRadiusPlayerFactionMembers:]` have no parser (only MES Event actions parse them). Defaults
  -1500 / 1500 / false always apply. **[HARD]** See `references/mes-reputation.md`.
- **Mod load order decides which definition wins.** Mods higher in the world's mod list override lower ones. **[SOFT]**
  `rep_world.py` shows which file each effective faction definition came from.

## Workflow

1. **See what the world really has**: `python scripts/rep_world.py "<save folder>" --defs` - factions in the save, the effective
   definition flags for each (and which mod set them), every human player's reputation with a Hostile/Neutral/Friendly
   reading, frozen (static) entries marked, plus the effective ReputationSettings/economy values. Read-only.
2. **Reputation won't move**: check the `[STATIC: frozen]` marks. Switch the faction to `StaticReputation:false` and zero the
   damage multipliers / decay if you only wanted to block vanilla mechanics. Reload the world.
3. **Unwanted faction in the save**: find how it was created (`references/factions-lifecycle.md`), stop the source, then with the
   game closed: `python scripts/rep_remove_faction.py "<save folder>" --tags SPRT` (dry run) and again with `--apply`.

## Scripts (Python 3.8+, stdlib only; tested on real saves)

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/rep_world.py` | Report factions, effective definitions (with source file), player reputation, settings |
| `scripts/rep_remove_faction.py` | Remove factions by tag from `Sandbox.sbc`: dry run, backup, XML re-parse before writing |
| `scripts/rep_common.py` | Save parser + definition resolver (vanilla, then mods bottom-to-top of the mod list) |

Paths default to a Steam install on `C:`; override with `--game`, `--workshop`, `--mods`.
